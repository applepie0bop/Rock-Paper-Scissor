The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a web-based interactive game that allows a user to play against a computer. It is a digital version of the classic hand game, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The game follows standard rules where each choice has a winning and losing counterpart. This project serves as a practical demonstration of web development fundamentals, particularly how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be combined to create interactive applications. It highlights the implementation of game logic, randomization, user interface (UI) design, and event-driven programming.
